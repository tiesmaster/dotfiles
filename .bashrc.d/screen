#TODO: get this working on all platforms, perhaps make it sense it's already
#	running within a screen and act on that (don't startup screen?, remap
#	shortcuts to new "shortcut-ring"?)
#TODO: perhaps put this in a subscript, if possible (but must be, since you
#	can source a script and call the potential function RunScreen()
if [[ $TERM != screen* ]] && [[ $- = *i* ]] ; then
#	exec screen -dRR
	echo "****screen temporarily disabled******"
fi

#TODO: maybe the following is necessary for reference when debugging on other
#platforms
	#[[ $TERM = screen || $- != *i* ]] || exec screen -RDD
	#[[ $TERM = screen || $- != *i* || -n $CYGWIN_ROOT ]] || exec screen -RDD
